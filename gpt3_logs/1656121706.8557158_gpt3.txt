views about the moral[ity] of terminating a pregnancy, even in its earliest stage. Casey, 505 U. S., at 850. And the Court recognized that the  2 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., dissenting State has legitimate interests from the outset of the pregnancy in protecting the life of the fetus that may become a child. Id., at 846. So the Court struck a balance, as it often does when values and goals compete. It held that the State could prohibit abortions after fetal viability, so long as the ban contained exceptions to safeguard a womans life or health. It held that even before viability, the State could regulate the abortion procedure in multiple and meaningful ways. But until the viability line was crossed, the Court held, a State could not impose a substantial obstacle on a womans right to elect the procedure as she (not the government) thought proper, in light of all the circumstances and complexities of her own life. Ibid. Today, the Court discards that balance. It says that from the very moment of fertilization, a woman has no rights to speak of. A State can force her to bring a pregnancy to term, even at the steepest personal and familial costs. An abortion restriction, the majority holds, is permissible whenever rational, the lowest level of scrutiny known to the law. And because, as the Court has often stated, protecting fetal life is rational, States will feel free to enact all manner of restrictions. The Mississippi law at issue here bars abortions after the 15th week of pregnancy. Under the majoritys ruling, though, another States law could do so after ten weeks, or five or three or oneor, again, from the moment of fertilization. States have already passed such laws, in anticipation of todays ruling. More will follow. Some States have enacted laws extending to all forms of abortion procedure, including taking medication in ones own home. They have passed laws without any exceptions for when the woman is the victim of rape or incest. Under those laws, a woman will have to bear her rapists child or a young girl her fathersno matter if doing so will destroy her life.

States may even argue that a prohibition on abortion need make no provision for protecting a woman from risk of death or physical harm. Across a vast array of circumstances, a State will be able to impose its moral choice on a woman and coerce her to give birth to a child. Enforcement of all these draconian restrictions will also be left largely to the States devices. A State can of course impose criminal penalties on abortion providers, including lengthy prison sentences. But some States will not stop there. Perhaps, in the

CONCISE SUMMARY:

RESPONSE:

The Court has struck a balance in the past between the State's interest in protecting fetal life and a woman's right to choose abortion, but today's ruling discards that balance. The Court says that from the moment of fertilization, a woman has no rights to speak of and a State can force her to carry a pregnancy to term. This will allow States to enact all sorts of restrictions on abortion, including bans on the procedure without any exceptions for rape or incest.
