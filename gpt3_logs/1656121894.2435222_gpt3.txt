CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Court overruled a prior precedent, Walton v. Arizona, 497 U. S. 639 (1990), which held that a defendant may make a prima facie showing of purposeful racial discrimination in selection of a jury venire by relying solely on the facts in his case. The Court held that the rule in Swain v. Alabama, 380 U. S. 202 (1965), which imposed a more demanding evidentiary burden, was no longer good law.
