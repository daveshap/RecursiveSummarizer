Quiet, please.
The
mutual broadcasting system presents Quiet, please, which is written and directed by Willis
Cooper and which features Ernest Chappell.
Quiet, please for tonight is called Where the Dead Man's Coat.
Let me see.
Yesterday that's one day, the day before that's two, the day before that that's three, three
days.
Three days all right, and Doc was right, well that fixes me.
You think it don't, well listen, you wouldn't know Kidney Foot Cassidy, would you?
Yeah, of course you wouldn't, you might have seen him if he was ever walking along Canal
Street around six in the evening in the summertime or if he was down near Wabash and Van Buren
under the ale of a winter afternoon.
He was the guy that put the bite on you for a dime to get to Oak Park because he'd forgotten
to spend his last 15 cents for a magazine.
He'd show you the magazine offer to give it to you for a dime, but that she never took
it.
You slipped him a dime and a dime and a dime and pretty soon he'd have enough to go to
a scene if he wanted to.
And that's the price of a half pint of the brown stuff in the bottles, he ain't been
handling any more, he ain't doing nothing.
The cops got under that Oak Park gimmick of his after a while and Kidney Foot was a little
slow in the head, see, and he's been doing that one so long he couldn't work up a new
kind of bite, so for quite a while he ain't had many dimes.
I used to see him a lot around Wabash and Van Buren or in the summertime over on Canal
Street.
Ain't nobody gonna see him anymore, any place, and he's dead, ain't anybody gonna ball over
Kidney Foot Cassidy if there's to be any ballin' done ball over me.
Three nights ago it was, that was, I was coming out of the drug store there, under the air,
it was around 12, 12.30, and I just had a cup of jab and a donut, who should brace me
but Kidney Foot Cassidy, he'd come waddling up, walking like his feet hurt him, that's
how he got his name, his right name was Waller, and he put the old Oak Park bite on me.
Ah, pardon me, mister, I gotta get to Oak Park, see, and I spent my last dime.
Hi, Kidney Foot.
Oh, hello, Floyd, never recognized you, what do you hear from the mob?
What mob?
Where's your overcoat?
Hmm?
Oh, I lost it.
You got two bits?
How'd you lose it?
Hmm?
Oh, I was asleep over there alongside the Polk Street Depot and somebody took it off
me.
You got two bits?
I got a dime.
I got 14 cents.
Ain't you cold?
Hmm, yeah, I sure am.
Yeah, it's been awful cold, ain't it?
You freezed to death.
I'm gonna get me a coat tonight.
How?
Hmm, I don't know.

What you been drinking, Kidney Foot?
Hmm?
Oh, I ain't been drinking.
Give me the dime, Floyd.

diamond by 14 cents and I can get some stuff for a fella over on Plymouth Court
yeah you get the drinking kidney foot you sure gonna freeze to death I'm gonna
get a coat well how take it away from somebody come on let's walk over to
Plymouth Court and find a fellow and get us a drink I don't call they was a time
when I first come to Chicago that's been many a year ago and I was broken had no
place to stay I was walking along Canal Street one night and kidney foot Cassidy
was the only guy in Chicago took pity on me bought me a cup of coffee left me
sleep in his room over on West Madison Street see so we've had quite a win in
Chicago this year I got a place to stay I got a room on North LaSalle Street
at least while the door lasts and I ain't seen kidney foot for a long time
and he's a lot older the poor guy is starving what am I gonna do and all I
gotta say is I wish I hadn't I got more than a dime I tell him about and I
offered to buy him a cup of jab and a hot dog over on South State in the
shooting galleries where the dogs are bigger even if they are staler the
kidney foot he don't go for eating drinking is his racket and it hasn't
killed him he ain't dead yet so I walk over to Plymouth Court with him that's
a little kind of alley off Van Buren between state and Japan it's all full of
printing houses it's dark there at night especially this time of night you can
hear his teeth chatter for two blocks and this three nights ago see I say to
kidney foot when they come home with me but he ain't interested all he can think
of is a bottle and I guess so we get the bottle from a little guy in a big
overcoat like a mackinac with a sheepskin collar that come out from
between a couple of buildings in the dark and after kidney foot takes a great
big slug out of the bottle he gets the coat
kidney foot was sore because the bottle busted when he clouded the guy but when
he took the coat off him there was two more bottles in the guy's suit coat me
I never done a thing but I couldn't I didn't have a chance one minute kidney
foot is slugging down rock got the next minute the guy is laying on the
cobblestones the old man's taking his coat he put it on he run his hands in the
pockets he wiggled down inside the sheepskin collar and he left hey I'm
warm Floyd I'm standing there with my face hanging out a foot warm I think

well what you gonna think he was right there he done everything but pinched the
old lady and she never seen him chevy hear that before getting
invisible wearing the coat of a guy you killed I never did either but boy it's no
kid sure him and me went out right past the house boy David he speaks to me
don't give kidney for the couple we walked down the street and kiddie foot
deliberately walks right into a guy and the guy begs my pardon the guy at
Thompson's thought it was cuckoo when I ordered two breakfasts he thought we
was only me kidney foot slips his mid into the cash drawer lifts a couple of
ten dollar bills he snatches a handful of nickels and dimes from a newsstand just
like everybody but me he was blind to him and then we're back in the house when
we read the newspapers he pinched there's the item about the fella they
got killed mystery and the old chills begin to crawl up my spine when it says
the cops I got a clue maybe they have maybe they haven't but there was two
of us there there's only one of us that anybody can see it's me all the time
Cassidy's sitting there wrapped up in that coat that dead man's coat I say
don't finally Cassidy will you take that coat off Floyd I I can't take it off why
not I tried it it won't come off stop it unbuttoned and take it off right I
tell you I can't take it on you kid I'm not kidding the buttons vote on button I
gotta keep on wearing it let me try gosh I can't get it on fast I know you can't
Floyd I remember the rest of the saying what's saying about the dead man's coat
it's it's something about how you're dead when you take it off
we tried all day every once in a while to get the coat off him but it was no
soak you could get a button unfastened and when you tried the next one the
person the button all over again Cassidy got scared scared so did I for that
matter twice during the day old lady Freiburg come running up to see where
our commotion was about it was Cassidy crying I always managed to shut him up
before she got in the room of course she couldn't see him by night time I was
pretty near nuts I got another bottle and finally he went to sleep all wrapped
up in his coat or the guy's coat sir I didn't sleep on that bed with him slept
in the chair what sleeping I done he woke up in the morning hollering I shut
him up I talked to him about how swell it was to be invisible but how we could
get in places jewelry stores banks rich people's houses over on Lakeshore Drive
all the time he kept sitting there wiggling in that coat he'd be trying to
take it off and then he'd all of a sudden think about having to be dead to
get it off he'd stop did I keep on talking about how nice it is to be
invisible and he's fidgeting and not listening much after a while idea come
to me it would be nice to be invisible and it would be nicer to be invisible
and not have kidney for Cassidy around I guess my talking can't run down
what's matter with you Floyd me nothing can you put you're looking at me
awful funny am I drink so I give him a drink I went out and I bought two more
bottles fifth money was going to be plentiful pretty soon see hey passed out
I sat there in the dark and thought long towards morning I made up my mind I'd
get rid of this guy that was hanging around my neck and I'd be invisible too
man think about that yourself sometime the things a guy could do if you can't
see him so it was seven o'clock in the morning when I went over the bureau and
got out my Georgia boxing club you know what a Georgia boxing glove is
switchblade knife blade about an inch long in the palm of your hand is wide
kidney foot was snoring kind of quiet and I went over the bed I give him a
Georgia boxing glove for a present the coat come off easy I put it on buttoned
it up and I went out for a walk I went to try it out see it was a success I
walked all the loop I rode streetcars for free I took a guy's pocketbook right
out of his hand pretty near noon when I decided to come back to my room and pick
up what odds and ends I needed nobody see me go in I went right up to the room
did I get a surprise Cassidy was still laying there he he hadn't bled at all
well lady Freiburg was there too having a cat fit there was two guys with her one
I spotted for a dick right away you couldn't miss the other guy was Ben
over Cassidy he was a doctor and I seen his grip well lady Freiburg was talking
I came up to change the bedclothes and there he was I don't know how he got in
here so Cassidy wasn't invisible anymore but I was and then the doctor turns around
how long has this man been here I don't know he wasn't here yesterday that's
funny funny how's it funny well it's funny because this man's been dead for
three days
